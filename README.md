## **The official plugin for Effect SMP : Reimagined.**


```
This plugin adds custom abilities and items based on default Minecraft effects.
```


- All players start with 1 effect heart and have to progress up to 3 hearts to be able to use all off their effects potential.
- There are 7 default effects which can be obtained on start and can be changed with the use of an effect reroll item which can be crafted. There are also 3 OP effects which can only be obtained by crafting an OP effect reroll item.
- Most messages of the plugin can be modified via the messages.yml.
- All craft recipes can be modified via the recipes.yml.
- The plugin can be configured via the config.yml.


```
BY DEFAULT THE PLUGINS LANGUAGE IS HUNGARIAN. YOU CAN CHANGE THE LANGUAGE IN THE CONFIG.YML FILE!
```


## Modification of plugin is allowed only if the creator ([me](https://github.com/mlnplus)) is credited for the base work.
